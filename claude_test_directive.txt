You are testing the LATS Codebase Analyzer MCP server. Your task is to thoroughly test and report on its capabilities.

TESTS TO PERFORM:

1. **Quick Overview Test**
   - Use quick_codebase_overview tool on the current directory
   - Report the file structure and statistics you discover

2. **Pattern Search Test** 
   - Use find_code_patterns to search for "class" in *.py files
   - Report what class definitions you find and in which files

3. **File Analysis Test**
   - Use analyze_file_structure on "lats_langgraph.py" 
   - Report the structure, dependencies, and insights you discover

4. **Deep Analysis Test**
   - Use analyze_codebase with task: "Understand the LATS implementation and architecture"
   - Let this run completely and report all findings
   - Note how many investigation steps it takes
   - Document any insights about the codebase architecture

5. **Performance Analysis Test**
   - Use analyze_codebase with task: "Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities"
   - Report any performance insights discovered

For each test:
- Report exactly what the tool returned
- Note any errors or issues
- Assess the usefulness and accuracy of the results
- Comment on the tool's effectiveness

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
Provide a comprehensive evaluation of:
- Which tools work best for different use cases
- The quality and depth of analysis provided
- Any limitations or areas for improvement
- Overall assessment of the MCP server's capabilities

Be thorough and detailed in your testing and reporting.
